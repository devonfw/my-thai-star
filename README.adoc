= My Thai Star

This repository is an **ADCS Capgemini** initiative that hosts an application reference called **My Thai Star**. This application is about the management of a restaurant.

== Technologies

This project is intended to be an example for the usage of new technologies in web development. Here is a list of all technologies involved:

* **Angular**

Client-side developed using the latest version of this framework: Angular 10.

* **Java**

Server-side developed using the 2020.08.001 version of **devon4j**.

* **Node**

Server-side developed using the basics of the NestJS framework. A node.js framework built on top of Express.js based on TypeScript language. This server-side backend is based on the **devon4node** incubator.

* **.NET**

Server-side developed using the **dotnet** framework.

* **Swagger**

Used this technology to define contracts between client-side(s) and server-side(s). So necessary when every back-end of the project (.NET, NodeJS and Java) is prepared to match with the Angular client exactly in the same way, being transparent to the user.

* **Production Line**

Tool used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Inside of this Jenkins and SonarQube are used. Also used **Docker** for the deployment in an external server.

* **Mr Checker**

MrChecker is a testing framework included in devonfw with several useful modules, from which we will focus on the Selenium Module, a module designed to make end-to-end testing easier to implement. More about it link:https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki[here].

=== Deprecated

Some folders have been marked as __deprecated__. They have not been removed for information purposes and in case it is necessary to recover previous work. They are the following:

- graphQL
- serverless

Use them at your own risk.

== Deployment

=== From code

To containerize the java backend use the below maven command:

`mvn package -Pdocker`

To run the docker image,

[source]
docker run --publish 8081:8081 --detach --name mtsj_java my-thai-star/java:<version> --network my-thai-star

This application can be easily deployed using **Docker** and **docker-compose**.

Use **docker-compose** to deploy reverse-proxy and angular front end.

`$ docker-compose up`

As  **Angular** is using **multi-stage build** built in  `node` and then deployed in `nginx`.

3 Docker containers will be created:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                        NAMES
23921e672489        mythaistar_java            "catalina.sh run"        3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        8080/tcp                                     mts_java
1acf2d6b6653        mythaistar_reverse-proxy   "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   mts_reverse_proxy
fdb63e26d299        mythaistar_angular         "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        80/tcp, 443/tcp                              mts_angular
```

The usage of the `reverse-proxy` only uses 1 port of the Docker host (where this is deployed), the `8080`. All internal communication of containers is done using docker alias of services.

=== From artifact

If we are using a CICD pipeline and we store the artifact on nexus, we can also deploy it without recompile all code. For this purpose there are three deployment pipelines:

- deployment: deploy all application with a reserve-proxy
- java: deploy only the java application
- angular: deploy angular application + reverse-proxy (you must run the java deployment at least once before running this deployment)

The result of this deployment will be the same as in the deployment from code, but instead of compiling the artifact again downloads it from nexus. All resources (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfiles and nginx.conf) are stored in the reverse-proxy folder.
