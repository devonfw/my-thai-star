= Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor Authentication (2FA) provides an additional level of security to your account. Once enabled, in addition to supplying your username and password to login, youâ€™ll be prompted for a code generated by your Google authenticator. For example, a password manager on one of your devices.

By enabling 2FA, to log into your account an additional one-time password is required what requires access to your paired device. This massively increases the barrier for an attacker to break into your account.

=== Backend mechanism
In the backend, we utilize Spring Security for any authentication.
Following the arrows, one can see all processes regarding authentication. The main idea is to check all credentials depending on their 2FA status and then either grand access to the specific user or deny access. This picture illustrates a normal authentication with username and password.

When dealing with 2FA, another provider and filter is handling the request from */verify*

Here you can observe which filter will be used.
*JWTAuthenticationFilter* does intercept any request, which enforces being authenticated via JWT

NOTE: Whenever the secret or qr code gets transferred between two parties, one must enforce link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246[SSL/TLS] or link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4301[IPsec] to be comply with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238#page-5[RFC 6238].


=== Activating Two-Factor Authentication

In the current state, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm[TOTP] 
will be used for OTP generation. For this purpose we recommend the *Google Authenticator* or any TOTP generator out there.

* Login with your account
* Open the 2FA settings
* Activate the 2FA Status
* Initialize your device with either a *QR-Code* or a *secret*

=== Frontend
These are the two main options, which you can obtain my toggling between *QR-Code* and *secret*.

After an activation and logout. This prompt will ask you to enter the OTP given from your device.
