= My Thai Star in Production Line

=== What is PL?

The Production Line Project is a set of server-side collaboration tools for Capgemini engagements. It has been developed for supporting project engagements with individual tools like issue tracking, continuous integration, continuous deployment, documentation, binary storage and much more!

=== Introduction

Although the PL Project is a wide set of tools, only 3 are going to be mainly used for My Thai Star projects to build a Continuous Integration and Continuos Delivery environment. All three are available in the link:https://devon.s2-eu.capgemini.com/#https://devon.s2-eu.capgemini.com/jenkins/[PL instance] used for this project.

. Jenkins
+
This is going to be the "main tool". Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the development with Continuos Integration and is going to host all Pipelines (and, obviously, execute them).
+
. Nexus
+
Nexus manages software "artifacts" required for development. It is possible to both download dependencies from Nexus and publish artifacts as well. It allows to share resources within an organization.
+
. SonarQube
+
It is a platform for continuous inspection of the code. It is going to be used for the Java back-end.

== Where can I find all My Thai Star Pipelines?

They are located under the *MTS* folder of the PL instance:

Those Jenkins Pipelines will not have any code to execute. They're just pointing to all *Jenkinsfiles* under the `/jenkins` folder of the repository. They can be found link:https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/tree/develop/jenkins[here].

//== Needed Resources

//As long as the final step of every implemented pipeline is going to be the *deployment*, it is going to be needed an external Deployment Server. This whole project is deployed in http://http://de-mucdevondepl01 .

//So, having both a PL instance and an external Deployment Server, the project is ready to be integrated in a CI-CD environment.
